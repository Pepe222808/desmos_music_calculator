# desmos_music_calculator
A calculator that takes notes in letter notation and outputs input for desmos to play music

To create a song just copy and paste console output in different lines in desmos
It should look something like this:

1. the braces of the sounds definition (f(x) = ...) may be pasted in wrong places so you just have to fix it yourself by putting one after the first "=" sign and one at the end after removing the last comma.
2. then you have to fill both of the spotted places in lists of elements (a[...]) by putting any variable as a slider

4. then set this variable to values from 1 to the last element of the list (the number that is returned in the console) with a step of 1 for example like this:

5. then just edit the speed by pressing the arrows under the play button of this slider

If the song is too long just make multiple sliders and divide the lenght of the list in equal parts but set next sliders from 0 to the divided lenght of the song
